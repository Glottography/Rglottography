\title{Collect sources referenced by a Glottography object}
\usage{
collect_sources(glottography)
}
\arguments{
\item{glottography}{A Glottography object of class
\code{glottography_features}, \code{glottography_languages}, or
\code{glottography_families}; a \code{data.frame} derived from a
Glottography object (containing a \code{dataset} column); or a
\code{glottography_collection}. For non-collection inputs, the function
identifies the associated datasets and retrieves their sources from the
local registry.}
}
\value{
A character vector of unique source identifiers referenced by the
input \code{glottography} object, in BibTeX format.
}
\description{
Extracts and returns the unique source identifiers referenced by a
Glottography object. If the input is a \code{glottography_collection},
sources are taken directly from the object. Otherwise, the function
determines the associated datasets, reads them from the local registry,
and collects all referenced sources.
